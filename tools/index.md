## [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)

The package and dependency-manager for PHP. More information and documentation can be found on [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org) and packages can be browsed and added at [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).


## [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com/)

Open-source tool for OS X drag & drop webfont creation, with support for OTF and TTF files.


## [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

Version Control System, VCS in short, Git is used for controlling versions and different branches of development. This way you can manage your versions and can go back in time, also work on your project easily with multiple developers without conflicts.

Git is widely supported in the development world. If you need a Git server/cloud service check out [GitHub](http://github.com/), commonly used for open source projects. [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.com/) is also a cloud service, but has free unlimited private respositories. Of course it's also possible to run your own server (see GitLab below).

A nice way to work with git is the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) approach. Which is also integrated in [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), a Git GUI for OS X. Want to practice your git commandline skills? [Github](https://github.com/) and [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) made a nice webapp to do this: [Try Git in 15 Minutes](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Want to know more? Read this: [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). When you've got the basics, read [Git Best Practices](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/).

For creating a secure connection you'll need to generate a SSH key, GitHub has a nice article about it: [Generating SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-mac)


## [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/)

A self hosted version of GitHub, commercial and community licences are available. To get started read [How to Setup GitLab](http://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-setup-gitlab-a-self-hosted-github) on Scotch.


## MAMP - Local development

Combine Mac OS X with Apache, MySQL and PHP and you'll have MAMP. There is an application with all-in-one, called [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html). Bitnami has [some stacks](https://bitnami.com/stacks/infrastructure) available too. I prefer to install and manage it myself using these:

* [PHP for OS X by Liip](https://github.com/liip/php-osx)
* [MySQL Community Edition](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
* Pre-installed Apache with vhosts and /etc/hosts

Also try [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/), which is a super simple plugin manager for Sketch.


## [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Nice alternatives are [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) which looks alot like Sublime Text, but is open-source and has a CLI and Git intergration (also check out [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui)). Adobe funded [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) which is also open-source and is completely build in JavaScript.
