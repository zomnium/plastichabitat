## Introduction

Plastic Habitat is a personal project to write an online book. An easy to read reference about all best practices for designing and developing cross-device websites. Instead of blogging about everything I want to create a structured reference instead. Which will be updated with developments within the ever changing web.

It's work in progress!


### Who is this for?

This reference is not a course for starting with webdevelopment, you should know some basics. Good places to start out are sites like [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/) (free), [NetTuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/) (free and paid), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) (paid) and [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/).


### Open Source!

Do you know the basics or have advanced skills? Then you probably find this a useful resource and I would appriciate to receive any feedback, advice and like to discuss. All content is open source and will be in a repository on [Github](http://github.com/), so you can fork, change, commit and make pull requests!


### A little about me

My name is Tim van Bergenhenegouwen and I'm a graphic designer who likes programming too. My interests are PHP, NodeJS, Front-end MVC and Realtime applications. Also I'm building an open source CMS called [Robodt](http://robodt.io/).

I run a small design and development agency in the Netherlands called [Slurfhondje](http://www.slurfhondje.nl/) (Dutch for [Elephant Shrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_shrew)) and like to create projects at [Zomnium](http://zomnium.com/). You can also find me at [Github](https://github.com/zomnium), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/slurfhondje), Zerply, Linkedin and [Flickr](http://flickr.com/benangerheim).
