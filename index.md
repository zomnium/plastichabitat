## Introduction

Plastic Habitat is a personal project for keeping notes about development. An easy to read reference about designing and developing cross-device websites/apps. Instead of blogging about everything I want to create a structured reference. Which will be updated with developments within the ever changing web.

*In short, it's work in progress forever!*


### Who is this for?

This reference is not a course for starting with webdevelopment, you should know some basics. Good places to start out are sites like [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/) (free), [NetTuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/) (free and paid), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) (paid) and [Code Cademy](http://www.codecademy.com/).


### Open Source!

Also a developer or designer, maybe both? I hope you'll find this resource useful and I appreciate feedback if you have any. All content is open source and is [available on Github](https://github.com/zomnium/plastichabitat), so feel free to fork!


### A little about me

My name is Tim van Bergenhenegouwen and I'm a creator of digital things. With a love for design and development I like to experiment, try things and learn stuff. Javascript, realtime applications and cloud infrastructures fascinate me the most.

I used to run a small design and development studio in the Netherlands called [Slurfhondje](http://www.slurfhondje.nl/) (Dutch for [Elephant Shrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_shrew)) and co-founded the privacy platform [Bitwolk](https://www.bitwolk.nl/). Currently most of my time goes into building [Hooray](https://www.hooray.nl/) which makes HR a piece of cake.
