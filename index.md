## Introduction

Plastic Habitat is a personal project to write an online book. An easy to read reference about all best practices for designing and developing cross-device websites. Instead of blogging about everything I want to create a structured reference. Which will be updated with developments within the ever changing web.

*In short, it's work in progress!*


### Who is this for?

This reference is not a course for starting with webdevelopment, you should know some basics. Good places to start out are sites like [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/) (free), [NetTuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/) (free and paid), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) (paid) and [Code Cademy](http://www.codecademy.com/).


### Open Source!

Do you already know how to develop websites? Then you probably find this a useful resource and I appreciate feedback if you have any. All content is open source and is [available on Github](https://github.com/zomnium/plastichabitat), so feel free to fork!


### A little about me

My name is Tim van Bergenhenegouwen and I'm a developer and graphic designer. My interests are PHP, NodeJS, Front-end MVC and Realtime applications. I'm also building an open source CMS called [Robodt](http://robodt.io/).

I run a small design and development studio in the Netherlands called [Slurfhondje](http://www.slurfhondje.nl/) (Dutch for [Elephant Shrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_shrew)) and like to create projects at [Zomnium](http://zomnium.com/). You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/zomnium), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/slurfhondje) and [Linkedin](//www.linkedin.com/in/timvanbergenhenegouwen).
